Project analysis of factors regarding NYC Airbnbs 

1. Of the airbnbs that have been reviewed in 2019, which neighborhood group has the most average reviews per month? Within this neighborhood group, what is the relationship between price and reviews per month? How does this neighbourhood group compare to all other neighbourhood groups?

2. What is the association between price and the number of listings an airbnb host has, controlling for neighbourhood group and room type?
